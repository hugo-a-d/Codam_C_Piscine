# Codam_C_Piscine

This repo contains all the work I was able to complete during my Piscine selection at Codam, which is part of the 42-network. This repo includes 'cells' on Shell, C and the rush group projects.The piscine was a great experience that threw out of my confort zone of dabbling in Python, and instead, had me grabble with UNIX and C. 

n.b there is one cell name 'test_C05' since it had small errors which prevented it from being prevent by moulinette.
